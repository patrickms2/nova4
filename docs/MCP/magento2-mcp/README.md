## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running the server directly

```bash
node mcp-server.js
```

### Testing with the test client

```bash
node test-mcp-server.js
```

### Using with Claude Desktop

1. Check your path node with `which node`
2. Go to the Developer settings and click "Edit config". This will open a JSON file.
3. Add the following snippet within the `mcpServers`:

```
    "magento2": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "MAGENTO_BASE_URL": "https://YOUR_DOMAIN/rest/V1",
        "MAGENTO_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
```

3. Replace `/path/to/your/node` with the path you checked in step 1
4. Replace `/path/to/mcp-server.js` with the path where you cloned this repo
5. You can get an API token from System > Integrations in the Magento admin
6. Restart Claude Desktop.
7. You should now be able to ask Claude questions about products in your Magento store.

## Development

### SSL Certificate Verification

For development purposes, the server is configured to bypass SSL certificate verification. In a production environment, you should use proper SSL certificates and remove the `httpsAgent` configuration from the `callMagentoApi` function.

### Adding New Tools

To add new tools, follow the pattern in the existing code. Each tool is defined with:

1. A unique name
2. A description
3. Input parameters with validation using Zod
4. An async handler function that processes the request and returns a response
