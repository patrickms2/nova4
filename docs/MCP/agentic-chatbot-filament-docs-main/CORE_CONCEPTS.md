# Core Concepts

This page explains the main building blocks of Filament Agentic Chatbot and how the knowledge layer connects to the parent-agent and workflow runtime.

## The Short Version

Filament Agentic Chatbot gives you a Filament-native control plane for running AI assistants inside a Laravel app.

The core flow can be as simple as:

1. Create a **bot**
2. Add **knowledge sources**
3. Let the system **ingest** those sources
4. Let the **parent agent** decide whether to answer directly, retrieve knowledge, or run a workflow
5. Retrieve relevant **chunks** when the answer needs knowledge grounding
6. Answer through the **chat widget** or your own frontend

Or it can become more advanced:

1. Trigger a **workflow**
2. Collect input or inspect the conversation state
3. Retrieve knowledge from the knowledge base
4. Route through **conditions**, **switches**, and **AI agent** nodes
5. Call **actions** or **HTTP APIs**
6. Return a guided response or complete a task through the widget, server API, Telegram, or Slack

## How The Pieces Fit Together

### Bot

The bot is the main runtime definition. It decides:

- which model and provider respond
- which sources belong to it
- how strict retrieval should be
- which users or areas can access it
- how the widget looks and behaves
- whether the experience behaves like a straightforward chatbot or a workflow-driven assistant

### Sources, Documents, and Chunks

A source is the input. During ingestion, that source becomes one or more normalized documents, and those documents are split into chunks. Text, file, and URL sources usually create one document. API sources can create one document per mapped API record. Those chunks are what retrieval actually searches.

That means the bot does not search whole files or pages at once. It searches smaller grounded pieces of content.

### Retrieval and Answers

When a user asks a question, the system can:

1. route the message through the parent agent
2. decide whether knowledge is needed
3. embed the query and find relevant chunks
4. format those chunks as context
5. return a grounded answer, often with citations

### Workflows and Actions

Workflows add task orchestration on top of the parent-agent runtime.

Instead of always producing one direct answer, a workflow can:

- ask follow-up questions
- classify intent
- route to different branches
- combine retrieval with AI processing
- call backend actions or external APIs
- send a final answer, summary, or next-step message

### Runtime Naming

The codebase still contains names such as `RagBot`, `RagSource`, and `RagAgent` for backward compatibility. Product behavior should be understood differently:

- the **bot** is the persisted assistant configuration
- the **parent agent** is the default chat runtime
- **RAG** is the knowledge retrieval capability used through `KnowledgeSearchTool`
- `RagAgent` is a legacy compatibility path, not the main chatbot architecture

### Conversations, Widget Runtime, and Channels

The widget is the default browser interface layer. Channel integrations let Telegram and Slack reach the same bot runtime without custom app-level controllers. The bot, sources, workflows, retrieval, conversations, channel connections, and delivery events live in your Laravel app and are managed from Filament.
