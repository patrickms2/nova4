# Filament Agentic Chatbot — Documentation

Public documentation for the [heiner/filament-agentic-chatbot](https://github.com/heinergiehl/filament-agentic-chatbot) plugin.

This repository is organized so buyers, evaluators, implementers, and support users can jump directly to the page they need instead of digging through one long README.

> For Filament marketplace `docs_url`, use [FILAMENT_PLUGIN_PAGE.md](FILAMENT_PLUGIN_PAGE.md), not this README. Filament renders a single raw Markdown file and does not resolve repository-relative links like GitHub does.

## What This Plugin Is

Filament Agentic Chatbot is the newer, broader plugin in the product line.

It keeps the grounded RAG chatbot capabilities of the earlier Filament RAG plugin and adds:

- visual workflows
- parent-agent orchestration with knowledge search and workflows exposed as tools
- branching logic
- AI agent nodes
- action and HTTP nodes
- API connectors for external services
- Smart Data Queries for safe natural-language lookups against allowed internal resources
- API-fed knowledge sources for JSON records
- package-owned Telegram and Slack channel integrations
- guided intake, routing, and escalation flows

That means it can work as:

- a straightforward documentation chatbot
- a product onboarding assistant
- a lead qualification assistant
- a support triage assistant
- an internal ops assistant with workflow logic

Docs should track plugin releases. If the plugin release is `vX.Y.Z`, the matching docs snapshot should be tagged the same way where practical.

The current compatibility baseline is `v0.12.0`: PHP 8.3+, Laravel 12 or 13, and Filament 5.2+.
