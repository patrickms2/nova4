# Operations Guide

## Queue Worker

Ingestion jobs run on Laravel queues.

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

If using a dedicated ingestion queue:

```bash
php artisan queue:work database --queue=rag-ingestion
```

`pending` sources are expected while waiting for retries after provider rate limits.  
If pending items do not move for several minutes, verify worker health and provider quotas.

## Scheduled API Source Sync

API knowledge sources can be re-synced periodically. The plugin provides:

```bash
php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:sync-rag-sources
```

Useful options:

- `--dry-run`: show which sources are due without dispatching ingestion jobs
- `--force`: sync matching API sources even when they are not due yet
- `--source=123`: restrict sync to one source ID
- `--limit=25`: cap how many due sources are dispatched in one run

Recommended scheduler setup:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('filament-agentic-chatbot:sync-rag-sources')->everyMinute();
```

Each API source still controls its own interval in the Filament form. The scheduler command only decides which enabled sources are due and queues them. Previous API documents remain active if a new sync fails.

## Dev Bootstrap

For local onboarding, run:

```bash
php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:dev-bootstrap
```

Useful flags:

- `--no-docker` (if services already run)
- `--services=pgsql,chroma` (start both services for backend switching tests)
- `--no-doctor` (skip readiness checks)

## Signed Widget Tokens

If enabled, all widget API requests require a valid signed token.

```env
RAG_WIDGET_SIGNING_ENABLED=true
RAG_WIDGET_SIGNING_KEY=your-long-random-secret
```

## Health Check

Run the built-in readiness command:

```bash
php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:doctor
```

Treat `FAIL` as a release blocker.

## Enterprise Smoke Test

Run this after migrations when validating API integrations, scoped bot tokens, usage budgets, and OpenAI-compatible provider setup:

```bash
php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:qa-enterprise-smoke --host=your-app.test
```

The command creates temporary QA bots, workflows, and Bot Access Tokens, then checks:

- JSON complete endpoint success through `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- area-scope rejection
- invalid-token rejection
- max input token budget blocking before provider execution
- OpenAI-compatible runtime alias creation and missing-base-URL failure

Temporary records are removed automatically. Add `--keep-records` only when you need to inspect the generated fixtures.

## AI Usage Monitoring

Use **Agentic Chatbot > AI Usage** to inspect stored provider usage events across bots and access tokens.

Use a bot's **Analytics** page to review per-bot token volume, estimated cost, provider calls, and active API tokens with monthly budgets.

## Data Resource Workflows

For workflows that use `query_data_resource`:

- Register the required data resources in the host app configuration.
- Restrict each bot to the minimum required resource keys.
- Add `field_metadata` for fields users may describe naturally, especially dates, numbers, prices, status enums, and names. This helps generated workflows map phrases like "newest", "top", "highest", "lowest", or "cheapest" to safe sort/filter fields.
- Re-check permissions and config cache after publishing configuration changes.
- Validate one real workflow run against representative production data before go-live.

## Go-Live Baseline

Before production launch:

- `RAG_VECTOR_BACKEND=pgvector`
- If app DB is MySQL, set `RAG_DB_CONNECTION=rag_pgsql` and configure `RAG_DB_*` PostgreSQL env vars
- Queue worker process is supervised (systemd/Supervisor/Horizon)
- `RAG_WIDGET_SIGNING_ENABLED=true` with a strong signing key
- Domain allowlist configured per bot
- At least one successful load test run against a production-like environment

## Load Test Baseline

Use a tool like k6 against chat endpoints. Start with:

- 10 virtual users
- 2-5 minutes duration
- realistic message payload size

Track:

- response latency (p50/p95)
- provider rate-limit responses
- queue backlog during ingestion

## Recovery Playbook

- If ingestion fails: inspect `rag_sources.meta.error`, retry ingestion from Sources table.
- If ingestion is pending: inspect `rag_sources.meta.retry_after` and `rag_sources.meta.retry_delay_seconds`.
- If API source sync does not run: confirm the Laravel Scheduler is active and run `php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:sync-rag-sources --dry-run`.
- If you changed vector backend/model settings: use `Re-Ingest Bot Sources` (bot page) or `Re-Ingest All Sources` (sources list).
- If chat rate-limited: reduce traffic burst and add retry backoff in clients.
- If retrieval quality drops: tune `top_k`, `min_similarity`, and source quality.
