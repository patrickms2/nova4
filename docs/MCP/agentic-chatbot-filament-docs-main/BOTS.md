# Bots

This is the page to share when someone asks what a bot is, how to create one, and how classic RAG behavior differs from workflow-driven behavior.

## What A Bot Is

A bot is one assistant configuration inside Filament Agentic Chatbot.

Think of it as the persisted product definition for one assistant experience. A bot tells the system:

- what the assistant is for
- which knowledge sources it can use
- how retrieval should behave
- whether the parent agent may use tools and workflows
- which workflow logic may run
- who can access it
- how the widget should look
- which external channel connections may route messages into it

This is why one Laravel + Filament app can run multiple assistants with very different behavior from one panel.

## Runtime Model

By default, a bot runs through the `ParentAgent`. The parent agent keeps the conversation natural and chooses between:

- answering directly from the bot prompt and conversation memory
- calling `KnowledgeSearchTool` to retrieve source-backed context
- calling `run_workflow` to start or resume the active workflow
- using any other registered tool available to that bot

RAG is still important, but it is not the whole chatbot. It is the knowledge capability behind `KnowledgeSearchTool` and workflow Knowledge Base nodes.

The legacy `RagAgent` class remains for compatibility when the parent agent is disabled and for workflow AI nodes that need a focused model call. Do not treat it as the default product architecture.

## A Bot Can Be Simple Or Agentic

### Simple RAG Bot

Use this when you want grounded Q&A over a knowledge base.

Typical flow:

- user asks a question
- retrieval finds relevant chunks
- model answers with grounded context

### Agentic Bot

Use this when the assistant needs to do more than answer one message.

Typical flow:

- user starts a conversation
- workflow asks clarifying questions
- AI nodes classify or generate content
- knowledge-base nodes fetch supporting context
- actions or HTTP requests move the process forward

## What You Can Customize Per Bot

Each bot owns its own:

- name and public ID
- system prompt and response behavior
- provider and model
- retrieval settings
- allowed domains
- context areas
- widget branding and prompts
- linked sources
- workflow-driven behavior
- channel connections for Telegram or Slack when external chat entry points are enabled

## How To Create A Bot

1. Open **RAG Bots** in your Filament panel.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a clear **name** and stable **public ID**.
4. Write the **system prompt** that defines the bot's role.
5. Select the **provider** and **model**.
6. Configure **retrieval** settings.
7. Configure **allowed domains** and **context areas**.
8. Customize the **widget** title, subtitle, welcome message, and quick prompts.
9. Save the bot.
10. Add one or more sources and test retrieval.
11. If needed, attach or build workflows for multi-step logic.

## Important Bot Fields

### Name

The human-readable label shown in Filament and usually in the widget header.

Use a name that tells the visitor what the assistant is for.

### Public ID

The stable identifier used by the widget and public chat endpoints.

Keep it slug-like because it becomes part of the integration surface.

### System Prompt

The system prompt defines the bot's role, audience, tone, boundaries, and fallback behavior.

It guides the assistant, but it is not a replacement for real source content or workflow logic.

### Provider And Model

Choose the provider and model per bot to optimize for speed, cost, or quality.

The built-in provider picker supports Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible gateways. Each provider includes a small curated model list, and the **Manual ID** option lets you enter exact model identifiers from your provider.

Use OpenRouter for routed models such as Qwen or DeepSeek variants without adding a provider-specific integration for each model family. Use **OpenAI-Compatible** when the provider exposes a chat-completions-style API with a custom base URL, such as Qwen DashScope compatible mode or a private gateway. Enter the base URL on the bot, or configure it globally with `RAG_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`.

For production examples, see [OpenAI-Compatible Providers](OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_PROVIDERS.md).

### Retrieval Settings

The most important retrieval settings are:

- `top_k`
- `min_similarity`
- context budget

These settings strongly influence whether a bot feels grounded, noisy, or too narrow.

### Capability Mode

Capability mode controls what linked workflows may do at runtime:

- `query_only` allows knowledge queries and read-only internal data lookups
- `write_only` allows structured writes or capture flows, but blocks query behavior
- `query_and_write` allows both

This matters most once a bot is linked to workflows.

- `query_data_resource` and knowledge search require query capability.
- `store_submission` requires write capability.
- `httpRequest` and `apiConnector` treat `GET` as query behavior and `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` as write behavior.
- Custom workflow actions can opt into capability enforcement by declaring `capability: query` or `capability: write` in `filament-agentic-chatbot.workflow.actions`.
- Untagged custom actions are not auto-classified, so treat them as application-level responsibility.

### Allowed Internal Data Resources

Bots can opt into specific internal data resources that workflows may read through `query_data_resource`.

Each enabled resource is:

- defined globally in config
- allow-listed per bot
- read-only at runtime
- limited to the declared fields, filters, sort options, and max limit

Use this when a workflow needs safe access to internal business records such as customers, cases, or orders without exposing arbitrary database access.

If you need tenant-aware or actor-aware row filtering, add that through your model scopes or resource design. The registry controls which model fields are exposed, but it does not invent your business-specific authorization rules for you.

### Smart Data Queries

The Behavior tab also includes **Smart Data Queries**. This is the admin-friendly layer above `query_data_resource`.

Admins choose:

- which data sources the bot may read
- whether generated workflows should accept natural data questions
- the default and maximum number of records for smart generated query flows

The workflow generator then handles phrases such as "newest workflow", "active products", "cheapest plan", or "highest priced item" by creating a structured query plan and passing it into `query_data_resource`. The runtime still validates all fields, filters, sorting, and limits against the allow-listed resource definition.

### Allowed Domains

Allowed domains limit where the widget can be embedded.

### Context Areas

Context areas help separate experiences such as:

- `public`
- `member`
- `admin`

### Widget Settings

Each bot can have its own title, subtitle, welcome message, quick prompts, accent color, style, and compact mode.

## When To Create A Separate Bot

Create a separate bot when you need a different:

- audience
- source set
- prompt behavior
- workflow behavior
- widget design
- provider/model combination
- access policy

## Typical Bot Patterns

### Public Product Guide

Grounded public Q&A over docs and FAQs.

### Sales Qualification Assistant

Guided questions, branching, and escalation for high-intent leads.

### Internal Ops Assistant

Runbook retrieval plus workflow-based triage and action execution.

### Customer-Specific Assistant

Dedicated knowledge, prompting, and branding for a tenant or client.

## Best Practices

- Keep each bot focused on one job and one audience
- Start with a strong RAG foundation before adding complex workflow logic
- Use workflows where structure matters, not for every single interaction
- Give the widget title and subtitle a clear user-facing purpose
- Test retrieval and workflow branches separately
- Keep the parent agent enabled unless you explicitly need the legacy direct RAG runtime
