# Release Notes: v0.12.0

`v0.12.0` is the agent-first runtime, workflow UX, and smart data query release. It is the next recommended early-access target after `v0.11.1`.

## Highlights

- **Parent-agent runtime by default**: normal chat now routes through `ParentAgent`, which can answer directly, search the knowledge base, run the active workflow as a tool, or ask for clarification. The older direct RAG path remains available for compatibility.
- **Smarter workflow follow-ups**: paused workflow runs no longer blindly consume every next message. The runtime classifies follow-ups as resume, cancel, interrupt, side question, or clarify before resuming a `collectInput` or `confirmation` node.
- **Provider-aware structured classifiers**: workflow turn routing and choice resolution use structured-output classifiers with provider-native schema handling where available, including the Ollama JSON Schema path for local testing.
- **Large workflow editor UX pass**: node setup was simplified across common nodes, the catalog is easier to navigate, field-level validation is clearer, the workflow navigator helps with larger canvases, and editor drag/save/publish interactions are quieter.
- **Smart Data Queries**: admins can allow internal data resources once on the bot, then generated workflows can handle natural requests such as newest, active, highest, cheapest, or filtered records through validated `query_data_resource` plans.
- **More reliable release validation**: workflow turn-routing evals, expanded PHPUnit coverage, and a Postgres sandbox smoke setup make the release candidate easier to verify.

## Upgrade From v0.11.1

1. Update your package constraint to allow `^0.12.0`.
2. Run `composer update heiner/filament-agentic-chatbot --with-dependencies`.
3. Run `php artisan migrate`.
4. If you have published the config file, merge the new `chat.parent_agent`, `workflow.input_interruption`, `workflow.choice_resolution`, `workflow.turn_router`, `workflow.store_submission`, and `data_resources.smart_queries` keys, or re-publish the config and re-apply local overrides.
5. If Filament assets are cached in your deployment process, run `php artisan filament:assets`.
6. Clear caches: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear`.
7. Run `php artisan filament-agentic-chatbot:doctor`.

## Notes

- Existing bots keep their knowledge-base behavior, but the product model should now be understood as bot -> parent agent -> tools, with RAG as the knowledge capability.
- Existing workflows continue to run. The new turn router mainly affects halted `collectInput` and `confirmation` steps by handling cancellations, topic switches, and side questions more deliberately.
- `query_data_resource` remains allow-list based. Smart generated query flows still validate fields, filters, sorts, and limits against the linked bot's configured data resources.
- No new package-owned database tables are introduced in this release. The workflow run status vocabulary now includes `cancelled`.
